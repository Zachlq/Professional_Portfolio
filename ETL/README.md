# ETL Personal Projects

#### Outside of my work at Forbes, I've developed ETL pipelines for my own learning, for tutorials posted on my blog, [Pipeline](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource) and to better understand and leverage my personal data.

## Project List

The ETL pipelines featured in this portfolio feature extractions of unstructured data from API end points and data scraped from the web.

- Mint: A pipeline for my personal finance app, Mint, which is connected to my various financial accounts. Using Mint's Python SDK, I connected the data, stored in BigQuery, to my Tableau account to track spending and forecast saving and investment opportunities.

- Most_Expensive_Watches: Using data scraped from Wikipedia, I ingested data to determine the most expensive watch brand in the world (spoiler alert: it's not a Rolex)

- Reddit_News: I created a pipeline to store data related to 9 news-related subreddits. 

- Rick_and_Morty: This pipeline fetches data from an open-source GQL (Graph Query Language) API; unlike the other pipelines, this build features pagination to retrieve results.
