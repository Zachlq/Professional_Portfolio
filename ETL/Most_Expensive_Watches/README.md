After my brother gifted me a nice watch for my wedding, I became interested in wrist watches. As a well-behaved married man I do my best to avoid the temptation to make impuslve luxury watch purchases. 

Thankfuly, those highlighted in my project TickTock: Finding The Most Expensive Watches in the World, are a bit above my pay grade. The pipeline featured here uses web scraping to scrape Wikipedia tables containing horological auction data. 

The story, along with visualizations, was featured in [Toward Data Science, Medium's leading data science publication](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-used-python-and-sql-to-find-the-most-expensive-watches-in-the-world-785ff71bc893).
