Since I studied journalism as an undergraduate and work in media, I'm still a news junkie. One of my favorite places to get news is Reddit, due to the intuitive aggregation and interactive comments sections.

While the original build for the Reddit connection was straightforward, it was one of the first ETL pipelines I built as a side project after a few months of being a professional data engineer. I recently revisited the pipeline and refactored it according to best coding practices, a process I recently [wrote about on Medium](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource/refactoring-a-python-etl-pipeline-with-example-e82392e36bb1).
