# Hi there! I'm Zach. 

![zach_and_mochi_gh](https://github.com/Zachlq/Professional_Portfolio/assets/58344148/ec3f6ee0-04f3-471b-9d56-f4f5e3972aed)

#### I'm currently a senior data engineer at Forbes where I leverage a GCP-based tech stack along with Python, AirFlow & SQL to build data pipelines that yield business insights, generate revenue and help optimize costs for internal stakeholders. 

#### As you might be able to tell, none of this impresses my dog, Mochi.

Outside of work, I'm active within the data science community, sharing my technological discoveries and career experience with a growing audience of aspiring data professionals on my blog, [Pipeline](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource).

Along with Andreas Martinson, I am also co-founder of [Learning SQL](https://medium.com/learning-sql/latest), a one-stop-shop for SQL learning resources for beginning data professionals. 

While earning my M.S. in Data Science, my school required students to create and maintain a professional portfolio.

As I explained in a blog post, which has the equally humbling and very specific distinction of being the [most-read data engineering story on Medium](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource/3-data-science-projects-that-got-me-12-interviews-and-1-that-got-me-in-trouble-f376682b4e21), my portfolio was instrumental in demonstrating my technical ability post-graduation. 

You'll notice that my projects are diverse in subject, approach and source data. To borrow from Google, when it comes to data science projects, my motto is: "Don't be ~~evil~~ boring."

I'm currently re-focusing the scope of this portfolio and updating it with newer work more indicative of my current interests and skills. 

If you're looking to get a sense of my technical and problem solving abilities, please start with the following projects:

- [TickTock: Finding The Most Expensive Watches in the World](https://github.com/Zachlq/Professional_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Engineering/PIpelines/Batch_Pipeline/Watches/watch_viz_work.ipynb). Featured in [Toward Data Science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-i-used-python-and-sql-to-find-the-most-expensive-watches-in-the-world-785ff71bc893?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).

- [A Rickin' Pipeline: Batch Pipeline Building with the Rick and Morty API](https://github.com/Zachlq/Professional_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Engineering/PIpelines/Batch_Pipeline/Rick_and_Morty/rick_and_morty_api_pipeline.ipynb). I first discovered the Rick and Morty API when compiling a list of [off-beat APIs](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource/free-offbeat-apis-for-data-engineers-to-practice-building-etl-pipelines-db61b3dc94a6) and later used the API to refine my ability to [integrate pagination into an ETL pipeline](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource/how-to-use-python-to-access-data-in-multiple-urls-with-rick-and-morty-6d0d3d502cb5).

- [R/Pipeline: A Reddit News Pipeline](https://github.com/Zachlq/Professional_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Engineering/PIpelines/Batch_Pipeline/Reddit_News/refactor_reddit_news.py). Read about the decisions I made to refactor on [Medium's Pipeline](https://medium.com/pipeline-a-data-engineering-resource/refactoring-a-python-etl-pipeline-with-example-e82392e36bb1).

Thank you for your interest in my work.
