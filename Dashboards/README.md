This directory contains dashboards I developed prior to joining Forbes in 2021.
They have primarily been used to demonstrate my data visualization skills; 
I now use them as teachable examples for proper data engineering and data analysis approaches.

Each was created using a combination of Python, SQL and Tableau with the final dashboard being rendered in Tableau desktop.

## Dashboard List

- __TED__: A dashboard evaluating the results of a hypothetical TED campaign, created as part of an interview process (disclaimers: I was paid for my time, the data was sample data and I did not sign an NDA forbidding the sharing of such a project)

- __Udemy__: A viz examining the online course platform Udemy's performance against competitor Edx. 

- __Tragedy Porn__: A dashboard chronicling the disturbing trend of adult film actress deaths before age 26. Inspired by the podcast the Last Days of August.
