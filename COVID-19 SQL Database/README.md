# COVID-19 SQL Database 

This was a final project for my data preparation course. I combined three types of data, static (CSV), dynamic API and tabular data scraped from the web to create a comprehensive SQL data base tracking information related to COVID-19 infection rates, demographic information and deaths at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in late spring 2020. The second half of the project involved manipulating the data using SQL syntax and using Python's seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visualize the information using a variety of graph types.
