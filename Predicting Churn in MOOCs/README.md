# Predicting Churn in MOOCs 

As an online student, I've had many resources available to enhance my education. One increasingly popular resource is the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). These courses are typically
shorter, less expensive and more accessible than conventional college classes. However, at the same time, they suffer from disproportionate attrition rates (90% or higher).
Therefore, this project seeks to leverage several multi-variable logistic regression models to make a binary prediction of whether or not a student will complete a course and earn
a certificate.
